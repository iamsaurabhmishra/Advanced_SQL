#Given a products table which contains 9 products, each row indicates the product number, name, and price.
#Write a query that finds, for each group, the difference between the lowest and highest price, and then calculate the average of all differences.

#script for creating and populating the table

CREATE TABLE products
(p_id int identity(1,1),
p_name varchar(25),
p_price int)
GO
 
INSERT INTO products VALUES ('Product - A' , 100),
('Product - B' , 120),
('Product - C' , 200),
('Product - D' , 270),
('Product - E' , 310),
('Product - F' , 370),
('Product - G' , 450),
('Product - H' , 600),
('Product - I' , 700)

The various products can be divided into three equal groups, based on their number: Number 1 to 3, number 4 to 6, and number 7 to 9.
The difference between the lowest and highest price of group 1 is 100, the difference of group 2 is 100, the difference of group 3 is 250. 
The average of 100, 100, and 250 is 150.
